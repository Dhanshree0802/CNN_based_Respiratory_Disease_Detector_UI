Respiratory Disease Classification Using Audio Data
This project focuses on the classification of respiratory diseases using audio data, specifically analyzing sound patterns indicative of diseases like bronchitis, pertussis, pneumonia, and asthma. The goal is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying audio samples into these disease categories.

Project Structure
Dataset: Contains audio files (.wav) categorized by disease type.
Code: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Models: Stores trained CNN models and their configurations.
Results: Holds evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and visualization outputs.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Audio loading and normalization.
Label assignment based on disease categories.
Visualization of audio waveforms and spectrograms.
Model Development:

CNN architecture designed for processing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features extracted from audio.
Training, validation, and test set preparation.
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion matrix analysis for understanding classification performance.
Results and Visualization:

Visual representation of training metrics (accuracy and loss over epochs).
Confusion matrix heatmap showing class-wise predictions.
Spectrogram and waveform visualizations for audio samples.
